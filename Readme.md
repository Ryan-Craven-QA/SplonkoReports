<h5>Day1: Hello World</h5>

1. Installed Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Created Directory for SplonkoReports in the terminal: mkdir <directory_name>
2. Changed directory to newly created directory
3. Created Virtual Environment: 'python -m venv venv'
4. Started up virtual environment
    * MAC: 'source venv/bin/activate'
    * Windows: 'venv\Scripts\activate.bat'
    
5. Installed Flask: 'pip install flask'
6. Created splonko_reports.py under the main directory
7. Created an app directed with __init__ and routes files as sub files
7. Exported splonko_reports.py into the virtual environment
   * MAC: 'export FLASK_APP=<application name>.py'
   * Windows: 'set FLASK_APP=<application name>.py'
   
8. In the virtual environment terminal, ran flask: 'flask run'

```
Everything was straight forward getting the app going.  Didn't run into any hickups along the way.
