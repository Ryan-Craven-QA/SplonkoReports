<h3> The idea behind Splonko Reports is to provide an open source opportunity to show: </h3>

1. Status of APIs that run of a schedule (WIP) -- Main goal
2. Poll / Pull Test automation results -- Stretch goal (will be implemented late)

--Why?
    I got tired of consistently having to run a newman script to run a collection of postman and 
    having to manually update the test results.
        --This will not replace applications like POSTMAN - this isn't a test application.
        --Rather, you'll be able to see a status of your API requests and see if they're passing
          of failing.
